# Simple Policies

This directory contains simplified versions of policies, likely intended for debugging, demonstration, or as starting points for more complex implementations.

-   `simple_rl_policy.py`: Implements a `SimpleRLPolicy` using the REINFORCE algorithm. This is a self-contained policy that includes its own update logic. It's a classic, policy-gradient-based approach and is useful for verifying the basic training loop and environment interaction.

-   `simple_marl_policy.py`: It is currently an empty file and serves as a placeholder for a simplified multi-agent reinforcement learning policy.
